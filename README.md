# Karatsuba-Algorithm
2-Term Karatsuba and 3-Term Karatsuba Algorithm on FPGAs
Optimizing large-scale numerical operations by implementing a
2-Term Karatsuba and 3-Term Karatsuba Algorithm in Verilog with diffrent bits to
improve the efficiency of Large-Scale numerical operations and
implementing the algorithm on FPGAs and compared execution
times and resource utilization with traditional multiplication
methods and done with 3 diffrent methods.
